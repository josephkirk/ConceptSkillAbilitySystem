# Concept-Based RPG Skill System Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for a unique skill and progression system for a tabletop or video RPG. The core idea is to move away from traditional class-based or fixed skill list systems towards a more fluid, emergent system where character abilities are derived from their understanding of fundamental "concepts" that make up the game world. Players will acquire these concepts through observation and interaction, embody them within their character, and combine or imbue them to create dynamic skills and empowered objects. Progression is tied not just to combat, but to a character's holistic engagement with the world and self-care. This revision introduces the concept of "Core Node Slots" for amplifying conceptual power within a character's body.

## 2. Concepts

Concepts are the fundamental building blocks of the system. They are abstract representations of the inherent properties, actions, or essences of things in the game world.

### 2.1. Concept Tiers

Concepts are organized into four tiers, representing increasing levels of abstraction and power. This tiered structure guides progression and the complexity of abilities that can be derived.

* **Tier 1: Basic Concepts (Physical):** Directly observable properties of matter and simple physical states.
    * *Examples:* Hard, Soft, Heavy, Light, Sharp, Blunt, Hot, Cold, Wet, Dry, Solid, Liquid, Gas, Rough, Smooth, Big, Small, Fast, Slow, Loud, Quiet, Bright, Dark, Solid, Liquid, Flexible, Rigid.
    * *Acquisition:* Primarily through observing physical objects and simple environmental phenomena. High chance of acquisition.
* **Tier 2: Intermediate Concepts (Action/Interaction):** Concepts describing what things *do*, how they interact, or simple physical processes.
    * *Examples:* Push, Pull, Cut, Strike, Burn, Freeze, Flow, Absorb, Reflect, Grow, Decay, Attract, Repel, Stabilize, Vibrate, Spin, Break, Meld, Join, Separate.
    * *Acquisition:* Observing actions, simple machines, natural processes, and interactions between objects. Moderate chance of acquisition.
* **Tier 3: Advanced Concepts (Magical/Energy):** Concepts related to fundamental forces, energies, elemental essences, and more complex or supernatural processes. Often associated with magic or potent natural phenomena.
    * *Examples:* Energy, Force, Mana, Aura, Channel, Transform, Conjure, Heal, Ward, Elemental [Fire], Elemental [Water], Elemental [Earth], Elemental [Air], Light (as energy), Shadow (as absence/manipulation of light), Sound (as a wave/force), Life, Death.
    * *Acquisition:* Observing magical effects, rare natural phenomena, spiritual entities, or through dedicated study and meditation. Lower chance of acquisition.
* **Tier 4: Abstract Concepts (Time, Space, Mind):** Highly abstract concepts governing reality itself, consciousness, perception, and causality.
    * *Examples:* Time, Space, Mind, Illusion, Spirit, Dimensional, Cause, Effect, Probability, Fate, Perception, Emotion, Memory, Dream, Void.
    * *Acquisition:* Through deep introspection, interaction with powerful entities, encountering reality-altering phenomena, or extensive research of esoteric knowledge. Very low chance of acquisition, often requiring specific circumstances or dedicated quests.

### 2.2. Concept Acquisition

Concepts are acquired through various methods, emphasizing interaction and discovery:

* **Observation:** By actively observing an object, creature, or event, a character has a chance to gain one or more associated concepts.
    * *Mechanics:* When a player declares their character is observing something, the GM determines relevant concepts. A die roll is made (the difficulty/chance potentially influenced by the concept's tier and the character's Perception or Intellect) to see which concepts, if any, are acquired. Tier 1 concepts have a higher chance than Tier 4.
    * *Example:* Observing a waterfall (Flow, Water, Loud - Tier 2 & 1), a skilled blacksmith at work (Metal, Hammer, Strike, Hard, Craft - Tier 1 & 2), a glowing rune (Energy, Bright, Symbol, Ward - Tier 1 & 3), or a temporal anomaly (Time, Space, Vibrate - Tier 2 & 4).
* **Study and Research:** Spending time reading books, deciphering ancient texts, or conducting experiments can grant concepts, particularly higher-tier or specialized ones.
    * *Mechanics:* Requires access to knowledge sources and successful skill checks (Knowledge, Research, Investigation). The concepts gained are usually directly related to the subject of study.
* **Experiential Learning:** Directly engaging in activities or interacting with the environment can solidify conceptual understanding.
    * *Mechanics:* Repeatedly performing an action (climbing, swimming, crafting) or enduring certain conditions (extreme heat, cold) can grant associated concepts. Proficiency in related mundane skills might increase the chance or speed of acquisition.
* **Mentorship:** Learning directly from someone who already understands certain concepts.
    * *Mechanics:* Requires finding a mentor and dedicating time to learning. May involve quests, payment, or proving oneself worthy. Concepts are often transferred directly or through guided experiences.
* **Introspection and Meditation:** Focusing inward or contemplating abstract ideas.
    * *Mechanics:* Requires dedicating downtime to these activities. Success might be influenced by a character's Wisdom, Willpower, or specific traits. Primarily grants higher-tier concepts.

## 3. Character System: Embodied Concepts

Characters don't just know concepts; they embody them within a system of conceptual "slots" tied to different parts of their being. This physical representation limits the number and type of concepts a character can actively integrate at any time and forms the basis of their innate abilities.

### 3.1. Body Slots

A character's conceptual capacity is divided into four main body areas, each naturally suited to different types of concepts. Within each area, there are standard slots and special **Core Node Slots**.

* **Head Slots:** Best suited for **General Concepts** (any tier) and concepts related to **Cognition, Perception, Knowledge, and Abstract Understanding** (primarily Tier 3 & 4). Represents mental acuity, awareness, and theoretical knowledge.
* **Body Slots:** Best suited for **Resistance and Enhancement Concepts** (primarily Tier 1 & 2, but also concepts like Life or Resilience from Tier 3). Represents physical fortitude, health, and the ability to withstand or recover from harm.
* **Arm Slots:** Geared towards **Action and Manipulation Concepts** (primarily Tier 1 & 2, but also concepts like Force or Channel from Tier 3 when applied physically). Represents physical strength, dexterity, and the capacity for physical actions. This area is typically split into Left Arm and Right Arm, each with their own slots.
* **Feet Slots:** Dedicated to **Movement and Balance Concepts** (primarily Tier 1 & 2, but also concepts like Swift or Teleportation from Tier 3 & 4). Represents speed, agility, and the ability to navigate the environment. This area is typically split into Left Foot and Right Foot, each with their own slots.

### 3.2. Core Node Slots

Within each body area, certain slots are designated as Core Node Slots. These are crucial for amplifying a character's conceptual power.

* **Amplification Effect:** A concept placed in a Core Node Slot enhances the potency and synergy of *all* other concepts slotted within that same body area (Head, Body, specific Arm, specific Foot). This amplification can take several forms:
    * Increased effectiveness of skills derived from concepts in that area.
    * Stronger passive bonuses from concepts in that area.
    * Enhanced synergy between concepts within that area, potentially unlocking more powerful combined effects.
    * Granting a chance for concepts to manifest passively during actions related to that body area.
* **Example:** If the concept "Elemental [Fire]" is placed in a Core Node Slot in the Right Arm, any physical skills originating from the Right Arm (like weapon swings) that are derived from concepts like "Strike" or "Heat" would be amplified, potentially dealing bonus fire damage or having a chance to ignite targets. Other concepts in the Right Arm slots, even if not directly fire-related, might gain a minor "fiery" aspect or increased potency when used in conjunction with Right Arm skills.
* **Standard Distribution:** Characters typically begin with a standard distribution of Core Node Slots:
    * Head: 1 Core Slot
    * Body: 1 Core Slot
    * Left Arm: 1 Core Slot
    * Right Arm: 1 Core Slot
    * Left Foot: 1 Core Slot
    * Right Foot: 1 Core Slot
    (Total: 6 Standard Core Slots)

### 3.3. Unlocking Slots (Progression)

Characters begin with a limited number of unlocked slots in each body area. Additional standard slots are unlocked through consistent engagement with mundane activities, representing the character becoming more attuned to their own potential and the world's concepts through self-care and practice.

* **Mundane Activities:** Engaging in activities like getting a full night's sleep, consistent physical training, eating nourishing meals, periods of meditation, or dedicated exploration contributes to a hidden "Progression Pool."
* **Accumulating Progress:** The quality and consistency of these activities determine the rate of accumulation. Exceptional acts (finding a rare ingredient, completing a challenging training regimen) provide larger boosts.
* **Leveling Up:** Accumulating enough in the Progression Pool results in the character gaining a "level." Unlike traditional systems, these levels primarily grant "Slot Points."
* **Spending Slot Points:** Players spend Slot Points to unlock new standard slots in the body areas of their choice. The cost in Slot Points might increase as more slots are unlocked in a specific area, encouraging some degree of balanced development unless specifically counteracted by other means. Core Node Slots are not unlocked with these standard Slot Points initially.

### 3.4. The Body Manual

The Body Manual is a rare and valuable resource that grants a character a deeper understanding of their own conceptual architecture. It allows for the reconfiguration of their body slots, including the crucial Core Node Slots, enabling specialization beyond the natural tendencies of each body area.

* **Function:** Using a Body Manual allows a player to redistribute their total number of unlocked *standard* slots across the four main body areas.
* **Core Node Reconfiguration:** Crucially, the Body Manual also allows for the redistribution of the character's available **Core Node Slots**. A player could move a Core Slot from their Body to their Head, for example, to further enhance mental concepts at the expense of physical ones.
* **Increasing Maximum Core Slots:** Access to more advanced or specialized Body Manuals might grant the ability to increase the *maximum* number of Core Node Slots a character can have across all body areas, significantly increasing their potential for conceptual amplification.
* **Archetype Enablement:** This allows players to mechanically embody different character archetypes by tailoring both their total conceptual capacity and where their most potent conceptual amplification occurs. A Mage would maximize Head Core slots, a powerful martial character might focus Core slots in Arms and Body, and so on.
* **Limitations:** There might be a limit to how drastically slots (both standard and Core) can be shifted, or a base minimum number of slots required in each area. Using a Body Manual might require dedicated downtime or have other in-game costs.

## 4. Object System: Concepts in the World

Objects are not static but are imbued with concepts, both intrinsically and through crafting. These concepts contribute to the object's properties and empower the user when equipped.

### 4.1. Object Concept Slots

Objects possess a set of conceptual slots, distinct from character slots.

* **Intrinsic Slots:** These slots hold the concepts inherent to the object's nature. They are fixed and cannot be changed through crafting.
    * *Example:* A basic iron sword's intrinsic slots might contain "Metal," "Sharp," and "Weapon."
* **Empty Slots:** These slots are open and can be filled by imbuing new concepts. The number of empty slots is a measure of an object's potential for enhancement.

### 4.2. Object Quality and Slots

The quality of an object directly influences its conceptual capacity:

* **Poor Quality:** Few or no empty slots. Intrinsic concepts may be weak.
* **Standard Quality:** A moderate number of empty slots.
* **High Quality:** A good number of empty slots. Intrinsic concepts are well-defined.
* **Masterwork/Legendary:** Many empty slots, potentially stronger intrinsic concepts, or even unique intrinsic concepts not found in lesser items.

### 4.3. Equipping Objects

When a character equips or wields an object, they gain benefits based on all concepts currently slotted in that object (both intrinsic and imbued).

* **Passive Boosts:** Concepts in object slots can grant passive bonuses to skills, attributes, defenses, or other relevant stats.
    * *Example:* An object with "Hard" and "Reinforced" grants increased armor value. An object with "Sharp" and "Precise" grants a bonus to attack rolls.
* **Object-Based Skills:** Some concepts, particularly when combined within an object, might grant the user access to specific skills that can only be activated while wielding that object.
    * *Example:* A staff imbued with "Channel" and "Flame" might grant the "Firebolt" skill to its wielder, regardless of the wielder's own mediated skills.

## 5. Concept Manifestation: Skills and Forging

Acquired concepts find their practical application through two primary methods: mediation into character skills and forging into empowered objects.

### 5.1. Skill Creation (Mediation)

Concepts can be combined and mediated to become active or passive skills that a character can utilize. This process represents the character internalizing and applying conceptual understanding as a personal ability.

* **Process:** Players select concepts from their inventory and attempt to combine them. The feasibility and outcome of the combination depend on the concepts chosen, their tiers, and the player's proficiency or relevant mental attributes (Intellect, Wisdom, Willpower).
* **Concept Compatibility:** Some concepts are naturally compatible ("Fast" + "Move"), while others might be less so ("Hard" + "Illusion"). Attempting incompatible combinations might fail or result in unpredictable outcomes.
* **Mediation Requirement:** Higher-tier concepts, especially Tier 3 and 4, often require a more involved "mediation" process (focused training, rituals, introspection) to be successfully integrated into a skill. This adds time and resource investment to gaining powerful abilities.
* **Skill Types:**
    * **Active Skills:** Abilities the character can actively use (e.g., "Fast Swing," "Firebolt," "Invisibility").
    * **Passive Skills:** Abilities that provide a constant or situational benefit without requiring activation (e.g., "Increased Resilience," "Enhanced Perception," "Faster Regeneration").
* **Slot Influence on Skills:** The effectiveness of a mediated skill is significantly influenced by the concepts it's derived from and where those concepts are slotted in the character's body, particularly if a concept is in a **Core Node Slot** within a relevant body area.

### 5.2. Forging (Imbuing Concepts into Objects)

Forging is the process of binding acquired concepts into the empty slots of an object, thereby enhancing its properties and granting it new abilities.

* **Process:** Requires an object with empty slots, concepts from the player's inventory, relevant crafting tools (forge, workbench, enchanting table), and a successful crafting skill check (Blacksmithing, Enchanting, etc.).
* **Selecting Concepts:** Players choose concepts to imbue based on the desired outcome. The tier and nature of the concept determine the type and power of the enhancement.
* **Filling Slots:** Each successfully imbued concept fills one empty slot in the object.
* **Crafting Skill:** The player's crafting skill directly impacts the chance of successful imbuing and the potency of the resulting effect. Higher skill reduces the chance of failure and leads to stronger enhancements.

### 5.3. Over-Slotting

A risky advanced crafting technique where a player attempts to imbue a concept into an object with no available empty slots.

* **Mechanism:** The player makes a challenging crafting check, often at a significant penalty. The difficulty is influenced by the object's quality and the tier of the concept being imbued.
* **Risks:**
    * **Failure:** The concept is not imbued.
    * **Degradation:** The object's quality is reduced, potentially lowering the potency of existing concepts or removing some.
    * **Breakage:** The object is destroyed, and all its concepts are lost.
* **Rewards (on Success):**
    * The concept is successfully imbued, adding its properties to the object despite the lack of a designated slot.
    * Potentially unlocks a "volatile" or unexpected side effect due to the forced integration of the concept.
* **Crafting Skill Influence:** A higher crafting skill significantly reduces the chance of degradation or breakage and increases the likelihood of a successful, albeit still risky, over-slot.

## 6. Synergy and Interaction

A key element of the system is the dynamic interaction between concepts.

### 6.1. Character-Object Synergy

Concepts in a character's body slots can interact with concepts in their equipped object's slots.

* **Reinforcement:** When a character has a concept slotted in a relevant body part that matches or is related to a concept in an equipped object, the effect of that concept can be amplified. This amplification is further enhanced if the character's concept is in a **Core Node Slot**.
    * *Example:* "Fast" in Feet Core Slot + "Swift" in Boots = significantly enhanced speed bonus and potentially emergent movement abilities. "Strength" in Body Core Slot + "Heavy" in Weapon = increased damage and potentially a chance to stagger opponents.
* **Unlocking Synergy Skills:** Certain combinations of concepts across character and object slots can unlock unique, temporary skills only usable while that specific conceptual link is active. These skills represent a perfect harmony between the character's innate understanding and the object's properties, and their power is increased by the presence of concepts in **Core Node Slots**.

### 6.2. Concept Combination Synergy

The combination of concepts within a skill or within an object can also lead to emergent properties and effects that are greater than the sum of their parts. The more compatible and higher-tier the concepts, the more potent the synergy. Concepts residing in **Core Node Slots** contribute significantly to the overall synergy calculations within their respective body areas.

## 7. Progression and Development

Character progression in this system is multifaceted and driven by player choice and interaction with the world.

* **Unlocking Body Slots:** Gaining levels through mundane activities provides the fundamental capacity for more standard concepts.
* **Acquiring Concepts:** Discovering and internalizing new concepts expands the player's potential for skill and forging combinations.
* **Deepening Concept Understanding:** Through repeated use or specific training, concepts can increase in potency or "rank," making them more effective when used in skills or forging.
* **Creating Skills:** Combining concepts into new abilities through mediation allows players to tailor their active and passive skill set. The effectiveness of these skills is enhanced by concepts in Core Node Slots.
* **Forging and Enhancing Objects:** Imbuing concepts into objects improves their utility and power, providing tangible benefits to the character.
* **Body Manual Customization:** Reconfiguring body slots, including the strategic placement of Core Node Slots, allows for adaptation and specialization into desired archetypes, significantly impacting a character's power profile. Access to advanced Body Manuals can increase the total number of available Core Node Slots.

## 8. Gameplay Implications

This system offers several unique gameplay implications:

* **Emphasis on Exploration and Observation:** Players are directly rewarded for engaging with the world and paying attention to details to acquire new concepts.
* **Meaningful Mundane Activities:** Daily actions like sleeping and eating have a tangible impact on character progression, making the downtime between adventures relevant and providing a non-combat path to power.
* **Highly Customizable Characters:** The combination of concept acquisition, standard and Core Node slotted concepts, and the Body Manual allows for an immense variety of character builds and playstyles, encouraging experimentation and deep personalization.
* **Dynamic Gear:** Objects are not just static bonuses but interactive elements that contribute to a character's abilities based on their slotted concepts. The search for high-quality items with ample empty slots and the strategic imbuing of concepts is a key driver.
* **Rewarding Crafting:** Crafting becomes a powerful way to create unique and potent gear, with the over-slotting mechanic adding a thrilling element of risk and the potential for exceptional outcomes.
* **Strategic Slot Management:** Players must make crucial decisions about which concepts to slot and where, especially concerning the limited and impactful Core Node Slots, to optimize their character's abilities and synergies.
* **GM Considerations:** Requires GMs to think about the fundamental concepts associated with everything in their world, track concept acquisition, manage object slots, and carefully consider the balance implications of amplified concepts from Core Nodes. Designing interesting Core Node distributions for advanced Body Manuals will be important.
