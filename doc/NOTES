- This project is Unreal 5.5 plugin to implement a Concept-based Skill System
# Design Pillars:
- Concept as the Universal Building Block: Concepts are the fundamental units of understanding and power in the world, representing the inherent nature of objects, events, and abstract forces across all tiers of reality (Physical, Intermediate, Advanced, Abstract).
- Understanding Through Observation and Interaction: Character progression and concept acquisition are driven by actively observing and interacting with the environment, emphasizing curiosity and engagement with the game world beyond combat. Mundane actions like sleeping, training, and eating are vital for a character's growth and capacity for concepts.
- Embodied Knowledge (Character Slots): A character's capacity to internalize concepts is represented by a finite, unlockable slot system tied to specific body parts (Head, Body, Arms, Feet), linking theoretical understanding and practical abilities to the character's physical and mental being.
- Concepts in the World (Object Slots): Objects possess inherent conceptual properties (intrinsic concepts) that grant passive benefits when used, and can hold additional concepts within their own quality-dependent slots, making gear an active part of a character's capabilities.
- Diverse Manifestation of Ability: Concepts translate into usable abilities through multiple distinct pathways: combining concepts into active skills, forging concepts into the properties of physical objects, and mediating concepts into internalized character proficiencies.
- Meaningful Risk and Reward: The system incorporates elements of risk in concept acquisition (random chance from observation) and particularly in crafting (the chance of object degradation or destruction through over-slotting), making successes feel earned and pushing players to weigh potential gains against potential losses.
- Synergistic and Emergent Capabilities: The interaction and combination of concepts, both within a character's own slots and between character and object slots, are central to the system, encouraging creative experimentation and leading to the emergence of unique and powerful synergistic abilities.
- Player-Driven Specialization: Character development is highly personalized, shaped by the player's choices in what to observe, which concepts to prioritize, how to allocate limited concept slots, and how to utilize tools like the Body Manual to customize their character's fundamental conceptual capacity, supporting diverse and flexible archetypes.
